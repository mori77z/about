    <div class="bio">
<p>Iâ€™m Moritz. I offer tailored solutions in digital, web, and industrial design, along with creative concepts. As a "tuttofare," an Italian term meaning "jack of all trades," my approach to design reflects my versatility and adaptability across various fields.</p>
<p>I merge captivating visual elements with functional design to enhance user experiences while embodying both artistic value and practicality. My work is inspired by subculture trends and early internet aesthetics, ensuring that each project represents a commitment to reason and aesthetics.</p>
<p>I offer a range of services, including visual design, branding, interactive elements, and content layout. I focus on creating environmentally friendly product designs, working towards the best solutions using my background in Industrial Design and freelance experience.</p>
        <p>From 2019 until February 2024, I studied at the Industrial Design Bachelor's Program at the University of Applied Sciences in Regensburg and am currently enrolled in the Master's Program in Design at HfG Offenbach.</p>

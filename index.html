Heey Im Moritz, i offer digital, web and industrial design solutions and creative concepts. Tuttofare which is an Italian term meaning "jack of all trades." describes my approach to design well as I am skilled in multiple areas, showcasing versatility and adaptability across various fields.
By merging captivating visual elements with functional design, I aim to enhance user experiences while reflecting both artistic value and practicality. My work draws inspiration from subculture trends and early internet aesthetics, ensuring each project embodies a commitment to reason and aesthetics.
I offer a range of services, including visual design and branding, custom graphics and icons, interactive elements, and organized content layout. With my academic training in Industrial Design and years of freelance experience, I provide adaptable design solutions that integrate aesthetics with usability.</p>
        <p>From 2019 until February 2024, I studied at the Industrial Design Bachelor's Program at the University of Applied Sciences in Regensburg and am currently enrolled in the Master's Program in Design at HfG Offenbach.</p>

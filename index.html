    <div class="bio">
<p>Moritz (b. 1999, Stuttgart) is a multidisciplinary designer whose practice spans industrial design, web, and digital solutions. His adaptable approach to design, characterized by the concept of Tuttofare—a jack of all trades—enables him to seamlessly merge creative innovation with functional practicality. Drawing inspiration from subculture aesthetics and early internet trends, Moritz delivers designs that prioritize both artistic value and usability.</p>
<p>From October 2019 to February 2024, Moritz studied Industrial Design at OTH Regensburg, where he exhibited his work at M26 Art Gallery. He also completed a semester abroad at Escola Massana, Barcelona, in 2021. His work reflects a commitment to sustainable product design, combining his academic background and freelance expertise to offer tailored solutions across diverse creative industries.</p>
<p>Moritz is currently enrolled in the Master’s Program in Design at HfG Offenbach, where he focuses on design research, publication, and developing new concepts. With a background in Industrial Design, he aims to enrich his work with theory and collaborate with other creatives from various fields to explore innovative ideas in a more interdisciplinary manner. Personally, he has a passion for digitally generated art, fixed gear bicycles, and fashion, which shapes his design perspective.</p>
